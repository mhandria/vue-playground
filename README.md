# Vue Playground

This repo is just a list of different things that I've used to play around with in Vue. 

## Running Locally

There isn't much to do to run locally just open `playground.html`

## Development

If you want to develop on this playground I highly recomend VS Code with `HTTP Server / HTML Preview` library installed.
